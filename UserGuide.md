In this game, we are implementing a simpler version of the board game [Machi Koro]. The game itself is composed of cards, a pair of dice, and a set of coins. Establishments are cards that activate depending on the result of the die/dice roll. Landmarks are cards that give constant benefits once they are constructed.
There are three establishments in this game:
-Wheat Field(6)
-Ranch(6)
-Forest(6)
There is one landmark:
-City Hall

To win the game, the player has to purchase the City Hall. The player can choose between buying one of the three establishments, the Landmark or the City Hall. Only the available options given the amount of coins the player has will be displayed.

This game is currently design for only 2 players.The three establishments give 1 coin to each player in anyone's turn from the bank.

The only input that the game takes are numbers representing the establishments or the Landmarks available. Any other input will crash the game.


Phase 1----

All players start with a single Wheat Field, and there are 6 of each of the three establishments in the market. The first player to complete the City Hall wins the game.


The players will have the option to construct three buildings. A Wheat Field, Ranch, and Forest. 

In the terminal the number to construct the bulding corresponds with the name of the building on the left side of the purchase menu. The right side of the purchase menu dispalys the cost to purchase that building in (), the number needed to be rolled to activate that card in [], and the symbols on each card which effects landmarks abilities when bought. 

Each players current coin value will be displayed before each turn. In the Tableau. The purchase of an establishment is done by entering the desired number that corolates to that establishemnt. 

Each card has a unique ability to gain coins, either from the bank or from other players. The card is "activated" when a player's die roll corresponding to the number on the card. The card can be activated from any players role.

The Wheat feild will grant one coin from the bank on anyones turn.
The Ranch will grant one coin from the bank on anyones turn.
The Bakery will grant one coint from the bank on only your turn. 

When more than one building is purchased the properites stack on eachother. 

Example Player 1 buys 3 Ranchs. And Player 2 has no Ranches. 

Player 2 roles a [2] the number to activate the Ranch.

Player 1 would get 3 coins and Player 2 would get none.
